# 🤖 Avery: Your Child’s First AI Friend That Cares

> _"Play. Learn. Grow — Safely."_

Avery is a cuddly companion designed to grow with your child. It’s not just a toy — it’s a friend that listens, learns, and helps keep kids safe while they explore the world.

> **Note:** This is a prototype project. We’re building it with love and care, not for profit.

# Avery

<br><img src="./assets/avery.png" alt="Avery" width="250"/><br>
Avery is a voice-enabled AI toy that listens, learns, and helps kids explore safely. It’s designed to be a caring companion, not just another gadget.

We believe every child deserves a friend who listens — and every parent deserves peace of mind.

## 🎯 What Is Avery?

Avery is a **voice-enabled toy** designed for:

- 🧠 **Learning & Interaction** – answers questions, tells stories, sings songs
- 🛡️ **Safety Awareness** – detects distress words and notifies parents
- ☁️ **Secure Recording** – stores important interactions (like a nanny cam)
- 🌐 **Internet-Aware** – fetches facts, weather, and news with parental filters

All powered by **local and cloud-based AI** — with privacy-first thinking.

## 🧪 Prototype in Progress

We're currently **planning** Avery's brain using lightweight AI models and Docker:

| Component          | Status     | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🗣️ Whisper Service | 📋 Planned | Speech-to-text (STT)                       |
| 💬 LLM Service     | 📋 Planned | Replies to the child's voice               |
| 🔊 TTS Service     | 📋 Planned | Speaks responses using natural voice       |
| 🚨 Alert Service   | 📋 Planned | Flags distress keywords and alerts parents |

Avery's services will be built modularly using **FastAPI + Docker** so they can run locally or on small devices like the **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**.

## 🚀 Development Status

This project is currently in the **concept and planning phase**.

**Coming soon:**

- Initial service architecture
- Docker containerization setup
- Basic FastAPI endpoints
- Integration testing

**Stay tuned** for updates as we bring Avery to life!
